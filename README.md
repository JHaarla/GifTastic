# GifTastic

This is a fun GIF viewer that the user can add more viewable categories to. This was created to learn about API calls and how to manipulate the returned data into something useful. In this case, we display fun GIFs. Everyone loves GIFs!!!

Live deployment: https://jhaarla.github.io/GifTastic/

**Under the Hood**

- AJAX API calls with custom query strings to the Giphy API
- Some pre-determined fields of the returned data are displayed on the DOM
- User can add buttons for more query terms
- All existing and added buttons are added to the DOM dynamically from an array via a for loop


*This is a homework assignment for UNCC Coding Bootcamp*
